# Microcorruption 

This Repo exists so that I can document my solutions to microcorruption. 
I've found the best way to make sure I learn is to make myself explain the solution in a public space where I need to be sure of my answer and not skip things.

The goal is to explain exactly where the vulnerability is in each program, why it exists and how to exploit it to unlock the lock.
